# Tic Tac Toe

A simple design for a Tic Tac Toe game, written in vanilla JS and styled in CSS.

Each time the game is started and the 'new game' option is selected, players are randomly assigned a 'circle' or 'cross' value. In case of a victory of one of the players the information is displayed in how many moves he managed to win and a new game can be started, in case of a draw the information is also displayed and in the same way we can start a new game.
